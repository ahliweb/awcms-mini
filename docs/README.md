# AWCMS Mini Docs

This directory contains the maintained architecture, governance, security, plugin, admin, and process documentation for AWCMS Mini.

## Read In This Order

1. `../REQUIREMENTS.md`
2. `../AGENTS.md`
3. `../README.md`
4. `../DOCS_INDEX.md`
5. the focused document for your task

## Folder Map

- `architecture/` - architecture constraints and repository/runtime guidance
- `governance/` - auth, roles, jobs, and regions guidance
- `security/` - security operations, recovery, and rate-limit strategy
- `plugins/` - plugin governance contract docs
- `admin/` - admin operating guidance
- `process/` - workflow, runtime validation, and deployment docs

Current planning reference:

- `process/emdash-alignment-and-security-plan-2026.md` - EmDash alignment and security recommendations backlog source

## Accuracy Rule

These docs should describe the real repository state, not just the intended plan. When implementation and planning diverge, update the docs to match the current code and call out rollout caveats explicitly.

## Validation Baseline

- `pnpm check` is the default aggregate validation path for routine local changes.
- `pnpm lint` and `pnpm format` currently use Prettier on the maintained docs/config surface, not the entire repository.
- Keep any issue-specific validation commands in addition to that baseline.
