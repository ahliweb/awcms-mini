/**
 * Guards `/admin/*` (Issue 8.1 — Build Admin Layout Shell).
 *
 * Found during live verification: returning `Astro.redirect(...)` from
 * inside `AdminLayout.astro` (a nested component rendered *within* a page,
 * not the page itself) throws `ResponseSentError` — Astro's SSR streaming
 * has already started flushing the page's own output by the time a nested
 * component's frontmatter resolves, so the render pipeline cannot swap in
 * a redirect response at that point. Middleware runs *before* any
 * rendering starts, so redirecting here is the officially-supported,
 * stream-safe place to do it. The resolved context is stashed on
 * `context.locals.ssrContext` (typed in `src/env.d.ts`) so `AdminLayout`
 * doesn't need to re-run the session lookup.
