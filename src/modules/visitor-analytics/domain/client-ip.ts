/**
 * Client IP resolution for visitor analytics (Issue #620, hardened
 * Issue #623, epic: visitor analytics #617-#624). Pure — a distinct,
 * more conservative sibling of `lib/security/rate-limit.ts`'s
 * `resolveClientIp` (which trusts `X-Forwarded-For` unconditionally for
 * rate-limit-key purposes). This one only ever trusts a forwarded header
 * when the deployment has explicitly opted in via
 * `VISITOR_ANALYTICS_TRUST_PROXY`/`VISITOR_ANALYTICS_TRUST_CLOUDFLARE`
 * (Issue #617's config gate) — same principle as `PUBLIC_TRUST_PROXY` in
 * the tenant-domain-routing epic: never trust a spoofable client-supplied
 * header without a trusted proxy in front that actually overwrites it.
 *
 * Returns `null` (never a fake "unknown" placeholder) when no IP is
 * resolvable — `null` correctly hashes to nothing and stores as SQL
 * `NULL` in `ip_hash`/`ip_address`, rather than a meaningless-but-real-
 * looking hash of the literal string `"unknown"`.
 *
 * Ambiguous-header fail-safe (Issue #623 acceptance criterion): a
 * forwarded header carrying more than one comma-separated value is
 * treated as an anomaly, not "just proxy chaining" — this codebase has
 * no "N trusted hops" configuration to anchor a "take the Nth value from
 * the right" rule on (same reasoning
 * `lib/tenant/public-host-tenant-resolver.ts`'s `extractHostHeader` uses
 * for `X-Forwarded-Host`), so an ambiguous header is logged as a warning
 * and never trusted, falling through to the next source in the chain
 * exactly as if that trust flag were `false` for this one request.
