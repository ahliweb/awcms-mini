/**
 * Scheduled publishing (Issue #541, doc issue #541 §Scheduled Publishing
 * Rules). A post becomes due when `status = 'scheduled' AND scheduled_at <=
 * now()` — the same `awcms_mini_blog_posts` predicate every other lifecycle
 * transition in this module already checks (`isValidStatusTransition`
 * governs the *legality* of scheduled -> published; this job is the thing
 * that actually performs it once due, since there is no external
 * cron/provider integration in scope for #541).
 *
 * Issue #640 restructured this from a single set-based `UPDATE` into a
 * per-post loop: the content quality checklist must gate this transition
 * too, not just the interactive `POST .../publish`/`.../schedule` endpoints
 * — otherwise a tenant could bypass the checklist entirely by scheduling a
 * post BEFORE the tenant applied full-online R2-only mode (or before an
 * editor fixed a since-flagged problem) and simply waiting for it to become
 * due, the exact class of gap Issue #636's "restore revision" bypass
 * already taught this epic to close for every new write/transition path.
 * A post whose checklist fails at due-time is left `scheduled` (not
 * silently published, not silently un-scheduled) and reported via a
 * dedicated audit event — an operator/editor can inspect and fix it, then
 * either re-schedule or publish manually once ready. Still idempotent: a
 * post already `published`, still in the future, or left `scheduled` due to
 * a prior blocked attempt simply doesn't match the `WHERE`/isn't re-blocked
 * twice in a way that changes anything on a re-run. `mediaPort` is supplied
 * by the caller (`scripts/blog-scheduled-publish.ts`, the composition root,
 * per ADR-0011) — this file itself never imports `news_portal`.
 *
 * Issue #643 (epic `social_publishing`): `socialPublishingPort`, when
 * supplied by the caller, is invoked right after each individual post
 * publish succeeds — `SocialPublishingPort.onArticlePublished(...)` with
 * `trigger: "scheduled_published"`. Plain DB outbox-row writes inside the
 * SAME transaction as the publish `UPDATE` above (ADR-0006 compliant — no
 * external provider call happens here); optional and defaults to a no-op
 * so a deployment that never wires a social-publishing port (the default;
 * see `social-publishing/domain/social-publishing-config.ts`) behaves
 * exactly as before this issue.
 */
/**
 * Per-run safety bound for the due-post selection (Issue #835 §6). The
 * previous query took `FOR UPDATE` on EVERY matching row with no `LIMIT`,
 * so a large backlog (job paused, a bulk campaign) locked and loaded the
 * whole set into one transaction and, worse, made a second concurrent runner
 * BLOCK on those locks. This bound + `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` (below) caps
 * the work/locks per run and lets a concurrent runner pick up a disjoint
 * batch instead of waiting. A backlog larger than this is finished on
 * subsequent scheduled runs (the job is periodic and idempotent) — reported
 * via `result.partial`, the same "partial this run, remainder next run"
 * convention `audit-log-purge.ts`/news-media reconciliation already use.
 * Ordered `scheduled_at ASC` so the longest-overdue posts publish first.
