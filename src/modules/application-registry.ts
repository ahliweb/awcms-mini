/**
 * Build-time extension point for a derived/downstream repository (Issue
 * #740, epic #738 `platform-evolution`, Wave 1).
 *
 * A derived repository forks/vendors this base repository, then REPLACES
 * the export below with its own `ApplicationModuleRegistry` — this is the
 * ONLY file a derived repository needs to edit to contribute application
 * modules to the final composed registry.
 * `src/modules/index.ts` itself (the reviewed base composition root) stays
 * completely untouched, and so does every individual base `module.ts` —
 * exactly the guardrail `docs/adr/0013-extension-layers-and-boundary-
 * model.md` §5/§9 and `docs/awcms-mini/21_module_admission_governance.md`
 * §7 require ("derived applications must not directly edit the base
 * module registry").
 *
 * Still 100% static, compile-time TypeScript, resolved and bundled at
 * `bun run build`/`bun run typecheck` time like every other import in this
 * repo — no runtime discovery, file upload, package scanning, `eval`, or
 * untrusted code loading. `src/modules/index.ts` imports this file
 * unconditionally and merges whatever it exports
 * (`module-management/domain/module-composition.ts`'s
 * `mergeModuleRegistries`) into the effective registry `listModules()`
 * returns.
 *
 * This base repository's own build ships `undefined` here — see
 * `src/modules/index.ts`'s own comment for why that keeps `listModules()`
 * byte-identical to its pre-#740 value (a default base build produces the
 * same effective registry as before this change).
 *
 * A real derived repository would instead do something like:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import type { ApplicationModuleRegistry } from "./_shared/module-contract";
 * import { salesModule } from "./sales/module";
 * import { inventoryModule } from "./inventory/module";
 *
 * export const applicationModuleRegistry: ApplicationModuleRegistry = {
 *   id: "awpos",
 *   modules: [salesModule, inventoryModule],
 *   migrationNamespace: { label: "awpos", rangeStart: 900, rangeEnd: 999 }
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * See `tests/fixtures/derived-application-example/` for a working,
 * in-repo illustration of exactly this shape (used only by tests — never
 * wired in here, since this file must stay `undefined` for the base
 * repository's own shipped behavior to remain unchanged).
