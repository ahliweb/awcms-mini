 * migration's header comment for the full story of why this needed to be
 * a brand-new, dedicated table rather than reusing
 * `awcms_mini_tenant_modules`/`awcms_mini_module_settings` (both were
 * tried, both failed — one silently useless, one silently exploitable).
 *
 * `markFullOnlineR2ModeApplied` is called ONLY from
 * `apply-news-portal-preset.ts` (the sanctioned entry point for this
 * preset) — no route/domain code anywhere else should import it. There is
 * deliberately no corresponding "unmark"/"clear" function and no HTTP
 * route exposes a write path to this table at all; the only way this
 * signal changes is by successfully re-running the preset activation.
