/**
 * Permission KEY CONSTANTS for the R2-only news media registry (Issue #633).
 * These are documentation/constants ONLY — this file does not touch
 * `module.ts`'s `permissions` array and does not insert any row into
 * `awcms_mini_permissions`.
 *
 * Why not wired up yet: `news_portal`'s own `module.ts` deliberately leaves
 * `permissions`/`navigation`/`api`/`settings`/`jobs`/`health` undeclared
 * until the corresponding feature is real (same convention `visitor_analytics`
 * used, Issue #617; see `module.ts`'s own descriptor comment). Issue #633
 * adds domain/application helpers only — no HTTP endpoint exists yet to
 * enforce these permissions, so declaring them in the module descriptor now
 * would sync permission rows into `awcms_mini_permissions` with nothing
 * that ever checks them, which is misleading (a permission that "exists"
 * but is unreachable). Issue #634 (direct-to-R2 presigned upload flow) is
 * expected to be the first issue that adds real endpoints — it MUST reuse
 * these exact string constants (not invent new ones) when declaring
 * `module.ts`'s `permissions` array and calling `authorizeInTransaction`
 * (skill `awcms-mini-abac-guard`).
 *
 * `activityCode` follows this module's own resource shape (`media`, plural
 * dropped to match e.g. `blog_content`'s `posts`/`pages` activity codes),
 * `action` follows the same verb set already used elsewhere in this repo for
 * a soft-deletable resource with an attach/detach lifecycle
 * (`blog_content`'s `posts.create`/`.update`/`.delete`/`.restore`/`.purge`).
