  // Issue #562 (tenant_domain): migration 032 seeded

  // no consumer added the actions to this union until the API landed —
  // same "seed permission first, add the action when a real endpoint
  // needs it" pattern `restore`/`purge`/`retry` already established (see
  // `identity-access/README.md`). Neither is added to
  // `HIGH_RISK_ACTIONS` below: `verify` only flips status based on fields
  // already on the row (no destructive/irreversible effect, same
  // reasoning as `retry`), and `set_primary` reassigns a routing flag
  // that can always be reassigned again — not destructive like
  // delete/purge. Both endpoints still require `Idempotency-Key` and are
  // explicitly audited regardless of this classification, matching
  // `retry`'s documented precedent (`isHighRiskAction` is metadata, not a
  // gate on idempotency/audit requirements).
  | "verify"

  // (secret-storage pointer) and disconnecting clears it; both classified
  // `HIGH_RISK_ACTIONS` below since they change credential-bearing state,
  // matching `configure`'s classification rather than `verify`'s.

  // Issue #641 (blog_content): `GET /api/v1/blog/posts/{id}/internal-links/

  // read` (an editor may be allowed to preview which terms would be
  // auto-linked without also getting broad internal-link *configuration*
  // access) — same "seed permission first, add the action when a real
  // endpoint needs it" precedent as `verify`/`set_primary` above. Read-only,
  // not added to `HIGH_RISK_ACTIONS`.

  // Issue #745 (data_lifecycle): `legal_hold.release` — ending an active
  // legal hold. Deliberately its OWN action (not reusing `cancel`/
  // `restore`/`configure`) so a role can be granted `legal_hold.create`
  // without implicitly also being able to `release` one — issue #745's
  // "default-deny release" requirement. Added to `HIGH_RISK_ACTIONS`
  // below: releasing a hold removes a data-protection safeguard that may
  // let purge/archive resume against previously-protected rows.
  | "release"
  // Issue #742 (domain_event_runtime): migration 056 seeds

  // consumers `POST /api/v1/domain-events/deliveries/{id}/replay` and
  // `POST /api/v1/domain-events/consumers/{name}/{pause,resume}` in this
  // issue. Neither added to `HIGH_RISK_ACTIONS` — `replay` re-attempts a
  // delivery whose side effect is required to be idempotent by event ID
  // (same non-destructive reasoning as `retry`), and `manage` (pause/
  // resume) only flips a per-tenant boolean that can always be flipped
  // back (same reasoning as `enable`/`disable`), neither deletes or
  // irreversibly changes data. Both endpoints still require
  // `Idempotency-Key` (replay) and are explicitly audited regardless of
  // this classification.

  // effect of activating a new one), `workflow.recovery.reassign`
