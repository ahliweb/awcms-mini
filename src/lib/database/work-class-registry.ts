/**
 * Job-side work-class registry (Issue #743, epic #738 platform-evolution).
 * Complements the ROUTE-side registry, which is entirely GENERATED (see
 * `scripts/work-class-registry-generate.ts` — every `src/pages/api/v1/**`
 * route that calls `withTenant(...)` already declares its work class
 * inline, either explicitly or by relying on the documented default, so
 * generating a snapshot from that source is strictly more reliable than a
 * second hand-maintained copy).
 *
 * Background jobs (`scripts/*.ts` that call `getWorkerDatabaseClient()`/
 * `getSetupDatabaseClient()`) have no equivalent inline declaration — they
 * do not call `withTenant`/`acquireWorkClassSlot` at all today (see below),
 * so there is nothing to generate FROM. This is therefore a small,
 * hand-authored, DECLARATIVE map: which work-class "bucket" each job's
 * connection usage should be attributed to for the capacity model/registry
 * drift gate, not proof that the job runtime-enforces that class today.
 *
 * ## Why jobs are not runtime-gated through work-class.ts (yet)
 *
 * Retrofitting all 9 worker scripts to call `acquireWorkClassSlot` around
 * their main loop is a real, separately-scoped follow-up (see
 * `docs/awcms-mini/database-capacity-runbook.md` §Known limitation), not
 * done in Issue #743: job concurrency is already bounded by a DIFFERENT,
 * already-existing mechanism — `src/lib/jobs/job-runner.ts`'s Postgres
 * advisory lock ensures at most ONE instance of a given job NAME runs
 * cluster-wide at a time, which is the dominant connection-storm risk for
 * scheduled jobs (an overlapping re-run of the SAME job, e.g. a slow purge
 * still running when the next cron tick fires). This registry still
 * requires every worker script to be explicitly classified — closing the
 * "every database-using process is included in the capacity model, or
 * explicitly exempted with rationale" gap — without also taking on a
 * runtime behavior change to 9 already-shipped scripts in the same issue.
 *
 * `scripts/work-class-registry-check.ts` discovers the CURRENT set of
 * worker scripts by grepping `scripts/*.ts` for `getWorkerDatabaseClient(`/
 * `getSetupDatabaseClient(` (ground truth — independent of whether a
 * module's `jobs:` descriptor also happens to list the script) and fails if
 * any discovered file is missing from this map, or if this map contains a
 * stale entry for a file that no longer exists/no longer opens a worker
 * connection.
