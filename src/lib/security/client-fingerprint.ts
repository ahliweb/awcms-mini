/**
 * Issue #821 — audit attributes for authentication events need to answer
 * "which source is this?" (brute-force / credential-stuffing forensics)
 * without persisting a raw client IP.
 *
 * A raw IP cannot go into audit `attributes`: `src/modules/_shared/redaction.ts`
 * deliberately treats `ip`/`ipAddress`/`clientIp`/`remoteAddr`/`x-forwarded-for`
 * as sensitive (Issue #687) and would replace the value with `"[REDACTED]"`
 * anyway — an unusable, permanently blank column. Renaming the key to dodge
 * that redaction would be a security regression, not a fix.
 *
 * A *keyed* hash resolves both requirements at once: the stored value is
 * stable, so an operator can group audit rows by source ("40 `login_failed`
 * rows, same `ipHash`, 40 different accounts" — the exact signal the audit
 * exists for), while the address itself is not recoverable from the audit
 * trail.
 *
 * Keyed (HMAC) rather than a plain digest on purpose: the IPv4 space is only
 * 2^32, so an unsalted `sha256(ip)` is exhaustively reversible in seconds and
 * would be pseudonymization in name only.
 */

/**
 * Reuses `AUTH_JWT_SECRET` (already a *required* env var — see
 * `scripts/validate-env.ts`'s required list) rather than introducing another
 * secret to provision, rotate, and validate for a purely internal
 * pseudonymization key. Key separation would be sound in the abstract, but
 * there is nothing here to separate FROM: `AUTH_JWT_SECRET` signs nothing
 * (sessions are opaque random tokens; `src/lib/auth/jwt-verify.ts` verifies
 * provider ID tokens with RS256 against published JWKS), so no
 * cross-protocol reuse exists — and a brand-new required secret would break
 * every already-provisioned deployment for no security gain.
 *
 * Because this IS now that variable's only consumer, its `deprecated` +
 * `removalVersion: "1.0.0"` marking in `src/lib/config/registry.ts` was
 * lifted (PR #839 security review): a variable scheduled for removal must
 * never be load-bearing for a security control.
 *
 * Throws rather than falling back to an empty key. An empty key degrades
 * this HMAC to a bare `sha256(ip)` — and the IPv4 space is 2^32, so every
 * persisted `ipHash` would become trivially reversible, silently, with no
 * error anywhere. A hard failure inside the auth path is strictly preferable
 * to an auth trail that quietly becomes a log of plaintext addresses.
 * `scripts/validate-env.ts` (`checkRequiredVars` +
 * `checkAuthJwtSecretNotDefault`) rejects both an unset value and the
 * documented placeholder at boot, so a correctly validated deployment never
 * reaches this throw.
 *
 * Read per call, not cached at module load, so a test (or a rotated secret)
 * that changes `process.env.AUTH_JWT_SECRET` takes effect immediately.
